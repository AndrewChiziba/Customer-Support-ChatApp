This a simple chat application to enable call center agents to chat with customers.
A customer care agent registers and signs into their account then turns on availability on the dashboard.
A registered customer can talk to an agent if there are agents that are available.
The system automatically connects the customer with a free agent and indicates if there are currently no free agents to assist the customer.
